#Linked List Visualization

This project is a dynamic visualization of a Linked List data structure. It provides an interactive interface to perform key linked list operations such as adding, removing, and setting values to nodes. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and aims to help users understand how a Linked List works in an intuitive and graphical way.

1) Add Node: Easily add a node to the linked list, either at the end or at a specific position.
   
2) Remove Node: Remove a node from the linked list by specifying its position.
   
3) Set Node Value: Update the value of any node in the linked list.
   
4) Real-time Visualization: Watch the linked list grow, shrink, and modify in real-time as you perform operations.
   
5) Multiple Input Capability: Enter multiple values at once, separated by commas, to create or modify nodes quickly.

Technology Stack

HTML: Provides the structure and layout for the linked list visualization.

CSS: Responsible for styling the linked list and making the interface visually appealing.

JavaScript: Implements the core functionality of the linked list operations and interacts with the user inputs.

How to Use

Adding a Node:

• Input a value (or multiple comma-separated values) in the "Add Node" field.

• Click the "Add" button to insert nodes into the list.

Removing a Node:

•Specify the index or position of the node to be removed.

•Click the "Remove" button, and the node at that position will be removed.

Setting a Node Value:

•Choose the index of the node and the new value you'd like to assign.

•Click "Set Value" to update the node with the new data.

Visual Feedback:

• As nodes are added, removed, or updated, the changes will be reflected in real-time on the visualization panel.

How It Works

This project models a singly linked list where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. The operations follow standard linked list procedures, allowing users to interact with the list through an easy-to-use interface.

• Add Node: Appends a new node at the end or at a specified position.

• Remove Node: Deletes a node from the list by unlinking it and reconnecting the surrounding nodes.

• Set Value: Modifies the data within a specified node.
